<p>The homepage is done. The homepage now shows for each post a full preview with the title linking to the actual post itself. This is fine for now, but will get heavy once we start serving more posts. I'm thinking I can just show just the first 5 or so posts as full previews and the rest as just the title with a link to the post, maybe in their own "archive" page, or maybe just in the homepage below the previews.</p>

<h3>What now?</h3>
<p>Well, I still need to add full markdown support (lists and code blocks) and maybe polish the style a bit, but I think we have a (<strong>very</strong> minimalistic) fully functioning static site generator on our hands. Actually, let's write what I need to do in the form of a list, so when I'm done implementing those this part will actually make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>List and code support for markdown</li>
<li>Locally stored images support (automatically move them form <code>posts/</code> to <code>output/</code> without any collisions)</li>
<li>Name collision detection for posts(?)</li>
<li>Some way to include the date of pubblication in the </li>
<li>Probably something else that I can't remember right now, I'll add more stuff fo sure</li>
</ul>

<h3>How am i gonna use this?</h3>
<p>I think I'm just going to use this as a general mind journal, maybe detailing my personal projects (whether related to computer science or not), but always as if I was writing on an actual blog. Who knows? Maybe I'll actually pubblish this someday. Of course, if I manage to keep writing at an acceptable rate, which we all know I will not.</p>
