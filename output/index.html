<p>Here's some stuff before the code</p>
<pre>
# this is not a title
inline code block
**mamma mia marcello**
</pre>
<p>other stuff <strong>after</strong> the code with some <code>inline code</code></p>

<p>Just a couple more things to add to the markdown compiler.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>=====</code> and <code>------</code> for titles and subtitles</li>
<li><code>[image alt text][number of image in an index]</code> for images and links</li>
<li>ignore markdown syntax in inline code</li>
<li>something is still up with closing lists</li>
<li>escape characters with a backslash</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm thinkng of some modifications I could make to Markdown, like embedding youtube videos and stuff, but what we already have is enough for a simple blog such as this one.</p>
<p>Maybe in the future I could also move away from <a href="https://newcss.net">new.css</a> and use my own CSS rules. There's no objective need for it, but there's also no objective need for yet another static site generator.</p>

         <p>03/08/2020</p>
         


<p>The homepage is done. The homepage now shows for each post a full preview with the title linking to the actual post itself. This is fine for now, but will get heavy once we start serving more posts. I'm thinking I can just show just the first 5 or so posts as full previews and the rest as just the title with a link to the post, maybe in their own "archive" page, or maybe just in the homepage below the previews.</p>

<h3>What now?</h3>
<p>Well, I still need to add full markdown support (lists and code blocks) and maybe polish the style a bit, but I think we have a (<strong>very</strong> minimalistic) fully functioning static site generator on our hands. Actually, let's write what I need to do in the form of a list, so when I'm done implementing those this part will actually make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>List and code support for markdown</li>
<li>Locally stored images support (automatically move them form <code>posts/</code> to <code>output/</code> without any collisions)</li>
<li>Name collision detection for posts(?)</li>
<li>Some way to include the date of pubblication in the </li>
<li>Probably something else that I can't remember right now, I'll add more stuff fo sure</li>
</ul>

<h3>How am i gonna use this?</h3>
<p>I think I'm just going to use this as a general mind journal, maybe detailing my personal projects (whether related to computer science or not), but always as if I was writing on an actual blog. Who knows? Maybe I'll actually pubblish this someday. Of course, if I manage to keep writing at an acceptable rate, which we all know I will not.</p>

<p>I'm working on the home page, and making a list of posts in chronological order for the blog. I'm also thinking of putting five or six of the most recet posts at the bottom of every post. I'm just worried about how to encode the pubblication date inside of the markdown file. Maybe make the first line into a timestamp?</p>

<h3>Todos</h3>

<p>I still have to finish the markdown parser by adding list support and multiline code. Regular expressions are not enough for those because they would need to work on multiple lines at a time. Lists especially are going to be a pain because of indentation. I'll figure something out, but it's probably not going to take too much time.</p>
<p>I should also probably make the program move locally stored images from the <code>posts/</code> to the <code>output/</code> folder on its own.</p>
<p>The important part here is the Home Page. Once that's done, I'll basically have a respectable minimum viable product on my hands, and an almost finished one at that: I don't care for all the extra features, this is just an exercise, there's plenty of much better and more polished SSGs out there.</p>
