# Multiline code support

Here's some stuff before the code
```
# this is not a title
inline code block
**mamma mia marcello**
```
other stuff **after** the code with some `inline code`

Just a couple more things to add to the markdown compiler.
* `=====` and `------` for titles and subtitles
* `[image alt text][number of image in an index]` for images and links
* ignore markdown syntax in inline code
* something is still up with closing lists
* escape characters with a backslash
I'm thinkng of some modifications I could make to Markdown, like embedding youtube videos and stuff, but what we already have is enough for a simple blog such as this one.
Maybe in the future I could also move away from [new.css](https://newcss.net) and use my own CSS rules. There's no objective need for it, but there's also no objective need for yet another static site generator.
